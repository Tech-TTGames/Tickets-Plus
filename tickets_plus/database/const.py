"""Constant variables used throughout the bot.

We use this file to store static variables that are used throughout the bot.
This is to keep the code clean and easy to read.
We also use this file to store the bot's version number.
Basically, this file is a collection of global constants.

Typical usage example:
    ```py
    from tickets_plus.database import statvars
    # Make use of the variables in this file
    print(statvars.VERSION)
    ```
